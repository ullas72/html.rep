<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this world. The longer you live, 
  the more you realize that in this reality only pain,suffering and futility exist.<br/>
  Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war… Those are the two realms belonging solely to man.
  Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do.They’re two sides of the same coin… to protect something… another must be sacrificed </p>

<p>“War brings death. And wounds and pain to both sides. There’s nothing harder to accept, than the deaths of those you love.
   So you believe they could never die. Especially those who haven’t known war.”<br/>
  “In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers.
  The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.”</p>

<p>“Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing… that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness.They spare the foe whose life is in their hands.
  But don’t you see? It’s an empty existence, to go on living… alone and unloved… when defeat’s already cost you your dream!”</p>
